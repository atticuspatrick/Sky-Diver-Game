# Sky Diver Game
Created by Alex Vokey, Atticus Patrick, and Anthony Mazzola

# Game Summary
In this game, the user is a skydiver falling through the air trying to avoid hitting clouds and getting wet. You can move left or right with the arrow keys and hit red items (they look like red minus signs) that help slow you down. The speed of the game will increase steadily as time passes. The user can also press the 's' key in order to manually speed up if they want a challenge. The starting and minimum speed of the game is set to speed level 5 and the maximum speed of the game is set to speed level 20. You have three lives and lose a life if your character hits a cloud. There is a 5 second 'grace period' after hitting a cloud where you cannot lose a life and once this passes you are able to lose lives again. As a player, your goal is to survive for as long as possible.

# Languages Used
This program uses OpenGL and GLUT from C++. The coding was split evenly between Alex, Atticus, and Anthony and specific sections are specified within the comments.

# Future Work
This game could be expanded to have different levels, a scoring system, or many items. It could also be possible to implement mouse listeners into it, but we couldn't find a way that made sense in this case.
